Project Team: Prashant Patel (Stack: React) 


## Introduction 
The feedback system is a web-based application designed to collect feedback from anonymous users based on different categories created by administrators. It facilitates user-generated reviews across various categories. Users can provide their review and experience for the category.

## Features: 
### Customizable Forms: 
The system allows administrators to create forms with various categories based on their specific requirements. Each category can be defined with appropriate questions or statements to gather relevant feedback. 

### Anonymous User Participation: 
The feedback system ensures the anonymity of the users providing feedback. Users can submit their responses without revealing their identity, promoting honest and unbiased feedback. 
### Categorized Data Collection: 
The system organizes feedback data according to the predefined categories set by the administrator. This categorization facilitates easier analysis and provides valuable insights into specific areas of interest.
